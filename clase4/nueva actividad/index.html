    <h1>Shinto</h1>
    <p>
        Shinto (literally “the way of the gods”) is Japan's native belief system and predates historical records. The
        many practices, attitudes, and institutions that have developed to make up Shinto revolve around the Japanese
        land and seasons and their relation with the human inhabitants. Expressions of Shinto beliefs toward nature
        include the recognition of a divine spirit (kami) in venerable old trees, large mountains, and tall waterfalls,
        as well as celebrations of the highlights of each season. (This reverence is often expressed by the placement of
        a small shrine next to the natural element being celebrated or garlanding it with a white rope.) Traditionally,
        Shinto also involves purification rites and customs to overcome the polluting effects of death and decay.
        However, Shinto does not espouse a moral code, lacks religious scriptures, and does not conceive of a life after
        death.

        The introduction of Buddhism to Japan did not cause the abandonment of Shinto. Instead, the pantheons of both
        religions were expanded so that Buddhist figures adopted complementary Shinto identities and Shinto kami were
        thought to strive toward Buddhist enlightenment. In this way, new converts to Buddhism were not obliged to
        abandon their traditional beliefs, and Buddhism was able to appeal to a wide range of people.
